  <p>I am a recent college graduate with a strong passion for learning, which stems from my sense of curiousity.</p> 
   <p>Curiosity has shaped almost every life decision I've made in life from education, work experience, and now programming.</p> 
    <p>In addition to my inquisitiveness, I am a quick learner with excellent communication and problem solving skills.</p>
